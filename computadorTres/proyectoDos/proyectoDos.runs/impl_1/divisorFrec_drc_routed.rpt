2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net controlUnit/IRwrite_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin controlUnit/IRwrite_reg_i_2/O, cell controlUnit/IRwrite_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net controlUnit/IorD_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin controlUnit/IorD_reg_i_2/O, cell controlUnit/IorD_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net controlUnit/aluOp_reg[2]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin controlUnit/aluOp_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell controlUnit/aluOp_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net controlUnit/branch_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin controlUnit/branch_reg_i_2/O, cell controlUnit/branch_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net controlUnit/memRead_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin controlUnit/memRead_reg_i_2/O, cell controlUnit/memRead_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net controlUnit/memWrite_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin controlUnit/memWrite_reg_i_2/O, cell controlUnit/memWrite_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net controlUnit/pcSrc_reg[1]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin controlUnit/pcSrc_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell controlUnit/pcSrc_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#8 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net controlUnit/pcWrite_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin controlUnit/pcWrite_reg_i_1/O, cell controlUnit/pcWrite_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#9 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net controlUnit/regDst_reg[0]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin controlUnit/regDst_reg[0]_i_2/O, cell controlUnit/regDst_reg[0]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
